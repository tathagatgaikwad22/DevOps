# ⚙️ Git Hooks for Automation — The Hidden Power of Git Developers Often Overlook  

If Git were a superhero, its *hooks* would be its secret weapon 🦸‍♂️.  

Git Hooks allow you to automate and enforce standards at the **local or server-side Git level**, long before CI/CD pipelines run. This makes your workflow cleaner, faster, and more reliable.

## 🧠 What Are Git Hooks?

**Git Hooks** are scripts that run automatically when certain Git actions occur.  
Think of them as **event listeners for Git** — triggered on events like committing, pushing, or merging.

📁 They live in the `.git/hooks/` directory of your repository.

### Types of Hooks

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Client-side hooks** | Run locally before or after Git commands | `pre-commit`, `pre-push`, `commit-msg` |
| **Server-side hooks** | Run on the Git server to enforce policies | `pre-receive`, `update`, `post-receive` |

## 🧩 Why Git Hooks Matter

In modern DevOps workflows, **automation** and **consistency** are key.  
Git hooks help you:

- ✅ Enforce commit message standards  
- 🧹 Run linters and formatters automatically  
- 🧪 Run unit tests before pushing code  
- 🔒 Prevent accidental commits of secrets or large files  
- 🚀 Automate post-push deployment tasks  

They make sure your repo always stays clean and production-ready.

## ⚙️ How Git Hooks Work

When you initialize a Git repo, `.git/hooks` contains sample hooks (e.g., `pre-commit.sample`).  
To activate one:
1. Rename it (remove `.sample`)  
2. Make it executable with:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```
3. Add your custom script!

## 🧰 Example 1: Pre-Commit Hook for Linting

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "🧹 Running ESLint..."
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Lint errors detected. Commit aborted!"
  exit 1
fi
echo "✅ Lint check passed. Proceeding..."
```

✅ Prevents committing unformatted or broken code.

---

## 🧰 Example 2: Commit Message Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
commit_message=$(cat "$1")

if ! echo "$commit_message" | grep -qE '^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}$'
then
  echo "❌ Invalid commit message format."
  echo "Use: feat(scope): short message"
  exit 1
fi
```

✅ Enforces a **Conventional Commit** format automatically.

---

## 🧰 Example 3: Pre-Push Hook for Testing

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "🧪 Running test suite..."
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Tests failed. Push aborted."
  exit 1
fi
echo "✅ All tests passed. Push successful."
```

✅ Stops you from pushing broken builds to the repo.

## 🧭 Best Practices for Git Hooks

### ✅ 1. Keep Hooks Lightweight
Avoid heavy operations; hooks should be fast and responsive.

### ✅ 2. Share Hooks Across the Team
By default, `.git/hooks` is not versioned. Use tools like:
- **Husky (JavaScript/Node.js)**  
- **pre-commit (Python)**  
- **Lefthook / Overcommit (Ruby)**  

### ✅ 3. Fail Fast, Fail Clearly
Always show clear messages for failed hooks.

### ✅ 4. Security First
Use pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets or AWS keys.

### ✅ 5. Combine Hooks + CI/CD
Hooks ensure local checks → CI ensures team-wide checks.

## ⚡ Tips & Tricks

💡 Auto-format code with `prettier`, `eslint`, or `black`  
💡 Chain multiple hooks for complex workflows  
💡 Log hook execution for audits  
💡 Keep hooks configurable via environment variables  
💡 Test hooks independently before committing

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

Git hooks are the unsung heroes of DevOps workflows.  
They help developers maintain high standards **automatically**, without depending on memory or manual checks.

> “Don’t just automate your deployments — automate your discipline.” 💪
