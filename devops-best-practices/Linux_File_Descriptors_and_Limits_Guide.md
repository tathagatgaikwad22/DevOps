# 🐧 Linux File Descriptors & Limits Guide

File descriptors (FDs) are at the heart of how Linux manages files, sockets, and processes.  
This guide explains **what they are, why limits matter, and how to configure them** with best practices, tips, and tricks.

## 📖 What is a File Descriptor?

- A **file descriptor** is an integer assigned by the Linux kernel to identify an open file, socket, or pipe.  
- It acts as a "handle" that processes use to interact with resources.  

Default descriptors:
- **0 → stdin (standard input)**  
- **1 → stdout (standard output)**  
- **2 → stderr (standard error)**  

👉 Beyond 2, every new file/socket opened by a process gets the next available FD.

**Example:**
```bash
exec 3> mylog.txt   # Open file with FD 3
echo "Hello FD" >&3 # Write to FD 3
exec 3>&-           # Close FD 3
⚠️ Why Do FD Limits Matter?
Linux enforces limits on how many files a process or system can keep open.
Exceeding these limits leads to errors such as:
EMFILE: Too many open files

This is common in:

Web servers (Nginx, Apache, Node.js apps)

Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

Messaging/streaming systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Logging-heavy microservices

Check your limits:
ulimit -n          # per-process max open files
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max   # system-wide max

🔍 Investigating File Descriptor Usage

Count FDs for a process
lsof -p <PID> | wc -l

List all open files on the system
lsof | less

Check system-wide usage
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr

⚙️ Adjusting File Descriptor Limits

1. Temporary Change (per session)
ulimit -n 65535

2. Permanent Change (per user)
Edit /etc/security/limits.conf:
youruser soft nofile 65535
youruser hard nofile 65535

Ensure PAM is configured in:
/etc/pam.d/common-session
/etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive
session required pam_limits.so

3. System-Wide Change (for daemons with systemd)

Edit the service unit file:
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65535

Reload and restart:
systemctl daemon-reexec
systemctl restart yourservice

✅ Best Practices
Set realistic FD limits based on workload (don’t just max everything blindly).

Monitor FD usage via lsof, Prometheus, Grafana, or CloudWatch.

Remember: containers may have different FD limits than the host.

Always close unused FDs in code to avoid FD leaks.

Perform stress testing to validate FD configuration before production.

💡 Tips & Tricks
Redirect file descriptors:
command >out.log 2>&1   # Redirect stderr (2) to stdout (1), then stdout to file

Debug FD exhaustion:
lsof -p <pid> | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c

Detect leaks in long-running processes:
Monitor FD counts over time → a steady climb = leak.

High-performance apps (Nginx, Redis, Kafka) often require 65k+ FD limits.

🛠️ Real-World Example
Your Node.js API server crashes with Too many open files.
Steps to fix:

Check ulimit -n → it’s 1024.

Increase to 65535.

Add LimitNOFILE=65535 in systemd unit file.

Monitor FD usage with lsof.

Problem solved ✅.

📌 Key Takeaway
File descriptors are the hidden backbone of Linux I/O.
By monitoring usage, tuning limits, and applying best practices, you can prevent downtime, crashes, and the infamous “Too many open files” error.
