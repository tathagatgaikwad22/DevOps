## 🧠 Introduction

Have you ever been midway through coding and suddenly need to switch branches to fix a bug?  
You can’t commit half-done work, but you also don’t want to lose it. That’s where **`git stash`** comes to the rescue!

`git stash` allows you to **temporarily save (stash) your uncommitted changes** and return to a clean working directory.  
Later, you can restore those changes exactly where you left off.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you run `git stash`, Git internally:

1. Creates a **commit object** for your current working changes.  
2. Creates another for staged changes.  
3. Saves both in a **hidden reference stack** (`.git/refs/stash`).

So, it’s like a **snapshot** of your progress — without polluting your commit history.

## 📘 Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git stash` | Save your current uncommitted changes |
| `git stash -u` | Include untracked files |
| `git stash list` | Show all stashes |
| `git stash show` | View the most recent stash |
| `git stash show -p` | Show patch (changes in detail) |
| `git stash apply` | Reapply most recent stash (keeps it saved) |
| `git stash pop` | Apply & remove the most recent stash |
| `git stash drop stash@{0}` | Delete a specific stash |
| `git stash clear` | Clear all saved stashes |

## 💻 Real-World Example

```bash
# Step 1: You're working on a new feature
git checkout -b feature/login
# Make some edits...

# Step 2: Urgent production issue
git stash
git checkout main
# Fix and commit the hotfix

# Step 3: Return to your work
git checkout feature/login
git stash pop
# Your work is restored!
```

## 🧩 Pro Tips & Tricks

### 1️⃣ Name Your Stashes
Always use descriptive names:
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: user login UI"
```

### 2️⃣ Stash Specific Files
You can stash only what matters:
```bash
git stash push path/to/file1 path/to/file2
```

### 3️⃣ View Before Applying
Review stash details before restoring:
```bash
git stash show -p stash@{1}
```

### 4️⃣ Apply Stash to Another Branch
Need to move your work?
```bash
git checkout new-branch
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

### 5️⃣ Recover Lost Stash
In case your stash didn’t apply properly:
```bash
git fsck --lost-found
```

## 🧭 Best Practices

✅ Use stash for short-term changes only.  
✅ Always name your stashes for clarity.  
✅ Clean up old stashes with `git stash clear`.  
✅ Avoid stashing large or binary files.  
✅ Double-check with `git diff stash@{0}` before popping.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

🚫 Forgetting to apply stashed changes (and losing them).  
🚫 Popping stash on dirty branches.  
🚫 Stashing without `-u` flag (missing untracked files).  
🚫 Using stash as a permanent backup.

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Action | Command |
|--------|----------|
| Save changes | `git stash push -m "message"` |
| See list | `git stash list` |
| Restore changes | `git stash pop` |
| Delete stash | `git stash drop stash@{0}` |

## 🧩 Why DevOps Engineers Love It

In CI/CD environments, clean commits are key.  
`git stash` helps avoid “WIP” commits and maintain a professional Git history.

It’s your **temporary workspace saver** — perfect for multitasking across branches.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

`git stash` might not be glamorous, but it’s a **true lifesaver** when juggling multiple tasks.  
Learn it, use it, and your Git workflow will become cleaner and safer. 🚀
